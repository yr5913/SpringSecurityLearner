This currently has very basic security using the default user name("user") and spring generated password(can be seen in
the application logs)

## API Endpoints

`GET /test/hello`: Test endpoint.

`GET /api/customer/get/{id}`: Retrieve customer information by ID.

`PUT /api/customer/delete/{id}`: Update customer information.

`DELETE /api/customer/update/{id}`: Delete a customer.
